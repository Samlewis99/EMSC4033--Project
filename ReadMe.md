## <span style="color:orange">Random Forest Tutorial </span>

This repository contains the random forest scikit-learn tutorial compiled by Sam Lewis.

To get started with this tutorial check out the "getting started" notebook in the notebooks folder.

This tutorial will guide your through the random forest package through an interactive walkthrough with some sample data. 

## Random forest brief summary
Random forests or random decision forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set. Random forests generally outperform decision trees as they solve the issue of low bias, but very high variance that deep decision trees tend to have.

## In this tutorial
In this tutorial we will be guided through a random forest classifer of the IRIS dataset. By the end of this tutorial you will have found the variables that are most important in this dataset, and created a random forest model.

You will be able to use the infroamtion learnt here on real world data that you may create in your studies. A good option to play around with can be found at the NOAA website. https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access.
